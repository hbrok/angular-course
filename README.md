# Wait and Eat

This is my version of the Angular Course ([github](https://github.com/gordonmzhu/angular-course-demo-app-v2), [course site](http://watchandcode.com/courses/angular-course)) app.

> Wait and Eat replaces paper waiting lists at restaurants.
>
> If you eat at restaurants a lot, you'll love the app because instead of waiting around for your name to be called, you'll just get a text message when a table opens up.
>
> If you own a restaurant, you'll love the app because it makes managing waiting lists really easy, reduces no shows, and creates happier customers that are more likely to come back.



The original app uses:
> AngularJS 1.5.x
> Firebase 3.0.x
> AngularFire 2.0.x
> Bootstrap 3.3.x

In my version, I've replaced Bootstrap with [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), and added [angular-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack) to try out webpack.

You can see the deployed version of this app at http://waitlistcourse.firebaseapp.com.
